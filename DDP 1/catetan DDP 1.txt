 Better alternatives (easier to accomplish common
tasks).
Best Practices:
 Many of the best parts of other languages are included in Python
 data structures (lists, dictionaries)
 control (iteration, exceptions)
 many packages (libraries) for common tasks
User base:
 Python is Open Source:
 freely available
 large user base, constantly contributing
 new packages available to meet changing needs

consist of four components:
1. Abstraction: ignore 
2. Decomposition: dipecah jadi kecil lalu di solve problem kecil itu.
3. Pattern recognition: setelah dipecah lalu diberi pola lalu cari solusi untuk pola tersebut
4. Algorithm design: design step-by-step instructions on how to carry out a task
